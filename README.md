# PHP-Website
My first PHP website about tutorials containing video tutorials from thenewboston and content from w3schools.
It contains captcha , google login and a little bit of bot security, guest login and admin login contains different priviledges.
Forgot username and forgot password features are also available.
People can send mail to the website owner regarding their query as well.
You can upload pics and thumbnail and watermarked images will be uploaded.
You can edit details of your account as well. Front end-HTML and CSS Back end -PHP

STEPS:-
1-You need to create a database "tutorials" and form 3 tables namely, "users","review" and "images".
2-"users" contains 6 columns:-"id","name","user","password","mobile","email".
3-"review" contains 5 columns:-"id","user_id","review","username","date".
4-"images" contains 5 columns:-"id","user_id","images","thumbnail","watermark".
5-Enjoy.
